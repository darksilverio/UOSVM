# UOSVM
UOSteam Script collection, consists of Scripts made for the [Freeshard Vetus Mundus](http://vetus-mundus.de/).

[VM Rules](https://vetus-mundus.de/index.php?article/2-shardrules/)


tl;dr: Scripting on Vetus Mundus is allowed, but if you gain any kind of resources or items with it, you have to have your eyes on screen while scripting.

# FAQ

- How do I use those Scripts?

  You need UOSteam installed. In UOSteam you simply copy the Scripts into a new Macro in the Macro tab, then hit Play. Make sure to read the instructions at the beginning of the Scripts.

- A Script asked me for an item and I clicked the wrong one, what do I do?

  Go to your UOS Macro Tab, click "Active Objects" and delete the Alias.

- A Script says I am missing a .wav Soundfile, what's up with that?

  Some Scripts include warnings if you are getting attacked, for example. You will need to put .wav files with the correct name into your UOSteam/Sounds folder, so they can be played properly. If it still does not work, make sure it is a proper .wav file and not a different soundfile, that was renamed to .wav .

  You can always test it by making a new macro and entering  " playsound 'test.wav' " , then hit play.
